## Github Action

- Configure the following repository secrets:

  - `TOKEN_GITHUB`: This should be a personal access token with read and write permissions for the repo.
  - `DOCKER_WEBHOOK`: This is a webhook that will be called after the image has been created. Useful for kicking off an automation to restart and re-pull the image. If you don't want to use this, delete the `Send POST request to webhook` action from the workflow in the `docker-image.yml` file.

- Push to Github `main` branch to kick off the workflow.
